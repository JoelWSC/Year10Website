    <h2> If you want to play these games then you have to not get caught. something
        you can easily do is move to a corner of the class and make sure the screen is facing away from the teacher,
        if you have a seating plan and you have to face the teacher then just turn your brightness down really low and
        only play when the teacher isnt looking. Obviously have everything on mute and every 10 minutes do 3 minutes of work.
        also try to play games that dont use your browser, this means it wont show up on your history. When playing games have
        your actual work open on another window so you can easiy switch when a teacher gets close.</h2>
